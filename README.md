Pagespeed for Apache Traffic Server
====================================
_This plugin is highly experimental and is still very much under development._ 

** THIS README IS INCOMPLETE, I WILL FINISH IT IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS **

Building
-------------------------------------
Dependencies to Resolve:
pcre-devel
yaml-cpp
atscppapi
zlib-devel


0. Download and Install atscppapi
ats_pagespeed is built on top of atscppapi, which is an opensource c++ api wrapper for Apache Traffic Server developed by LinkedIn.

  To build and install atscppapi follow the instructions available here: https://github.com/linkedin/atscppapi

1. Install yaml-cpp-0.3.0

Typically this can be done via
    
    sudo yum install yaml-cpp-0.3.0 yaml-cpp-devel-0.3.0

If not download the 0.3.0 source from (http://code.google.com/p/yaml-cpp/) and follow these commands     
    
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON ..
    make
    sudo make install
    
2. Build Pagespeed Libraries
    
    cd lib/
   
    We have included a tar.gz version of the pagespeed library code, if you wish to build off of this
    version just extract it and skip to step 2.3.
    
2.1 Install Depot Tools
    
    cd lib & \
    svn co http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/tools/depot_tools && \
    export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/depot_tools && \
    cd -
        
2.2 Checkout Pagespeed

More information on the following steps can be found at https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/mod_pagespeed/build_from_source.
From within the lib/ folder
    
    cd lib && \
    gclient config http://modpagespeed.googlecode.com/svn/branches/27/src ; \
    gclient sync --force --jobs=1

    You will now have a src/ folder created under lib with the 27 branch version of mod_pagespeed.
2.3 Build Pagespeed
Next, build mod_pagespeed, although we are not using mod_pagespeed in order to get the pagespeed
sdk you must build mod_pagespeed.
 
    make V=1 -j -C lib/src/net/instaweb/automatic/ BUILDTYPE=Release &&
    make V=1 -j -C lib/src/ BUILDTYPE=Release

To build in debug mode:
    
    Note: For some reason with -O0 it causes stat64 to be undefined at runtime.
    
    cd lib
    tar xzvf psol.src.tar.gz 
    export CCFLAGS="-O1" && \
    export CFLAGS="-O1" && \
    export CXXFLAGS="-O1" && \
    make V=1 -j -C lib/src/net/instaweb/automatic/ BUILDTYPE=Debug && \
    make V=1 -j -C lib/src/ BUILDTYPE=Debug
    
3. Build ats_pagespeed

From within the root ats_pagespeed directory, run the following:

    autoreconf -i
    ./configure
    make -j V=1
